Required modules to run the program
The cloud database being hosted only contains a small dataset for hosting purposes; despite the constraint we will still be able to get a good grap of the application's underlying querying logic.
Full dataset can be fetched from ergast f1api

The required libraries end user would need to install include:
pillow
os
tkinter
mysqlconnector

Installation:
In your local terminal where your program name is let's say: "module-1"
Then you would have to enter the command "pip install module-1"
