 🏎️ F1 Insight – A Tkinter-based F1 Database App

Welcome to **F1 Insight**, a visually rich and interactive desktop application built using **Tkinter**. Dive deep into the world of Formula 1 with a powerful blend of data, AI, and user-friendly design!

🚀 Features
 🧠 Natural Language Querying (User Mode)
Use plain English to explore F1 data, like:
